I am a 28 year old scientific researcher living in South Africa. I graduated with a PhD in Entomology (insects) from Rhodes University (South Africa) in early 2021. My PhD required me to develop my statistical capabilities (having only taken some undergrad stats courses). I built a range of models to predict the outcome of insect herbivory on plant population dynamics. In the process, I developed a passion for data analysis, statistical modeling and writing code. My other passion in life is sports. I have always been an avid sports fan, so I hope this blog will be a platform for me to combine my love for sports and data analytics. On the rare occasions when I am not at my day job, writing `R` code or watching sports, you'll find me drinking good coffee and cooking new recipes.

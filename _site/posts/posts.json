If I had to run, shoot, defend, sprint, screen like the NBA pros do… I would be lying on the floor, gasping for air within the 1st quarter. This got me thinking, do NBA players get tired? Does their performance vary over time? Do they make fewer rebounds or field goals the longer they have been on the court? While this is certainly a topic that peeks my interest, there are also some practical implications. For example, it could be quite informative to identify optical performance thresholds for each player to know:\r\nhow long can they perform at their peek abilities per game? (e.g. how many minutes per game is optimal for their performance?), and\r\n\r\nhow long each stint on court during the game should be to maximise performance?\r\n\r\nIn my first blog post, I will be exploring these two questions using some basic data visualisations. Later blogposts will get into a bit more detail (building some statistical models) - stay tuned!\r\nLoad required packages\r\nThe workhorse package we will be using is the NBA stats API package nbastatR. We need to install the package from GitHub, which only needs to be done once.\r\n\r\n\r\n# To install a GitHub package: \r\ndevtools::install_github(\"abresler/nbastatR\")\r\n\r\n# Once you have downloaded a GitHub package, we should then\r\n# edit our code so that the package is not re-installed each time we \r\n# re-run our script. We place a '#' in front of the command to comment it out. \r\n# If we need to run that code again later, we simply remove the '#' \r\n# devtools::install_github(\"abresler/nbastatR\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOur next step is to load the other packages we will require for this analysis. I really like using the pacman package to install/load R packages. I find this really helps when sharing code with collaborators who are less familiar with R. They can just open the script and press ‘run’ and not have to worry about installing new packages. pacman will install any packages that are not installed on your machine, and load all the remaining packages.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Load required packages \r\nif (!require(\"pacman\")) install.packages(\"pacman\")\r\npacman::p_load(tidyverse, \r\n               lubridate,\r\n               zoo,\r\n               janitor,\r\n               nbastatR,\r\n               future,\r\n               scales)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDownloading play-by-play data\r\nWe will now use the nbastatR package to download play-by-play data from the NBA API. We can download data for different seasons, different teams… This can take a really long time (at least it does on my PC), so below, I will just download the data for (1) the 2019/2020 season, and (2) only the Milwaukee Bucks.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Extract all games for the 2020 season (excluding pre-season and all-star weekend)\r\ngame_logs <- game_logs(seasons = 2020)\r\n\r\n# Process the game logs \r\ngames <- game_logs %>%\r\n  # Keep only these columns \r\n  dplyr::select(idGame, slugTeam, slugOpponent, locationGame) %>%\r\n  # Use a conditional statement to process the team home/away data \r\n  dplyr::mutate(slugTeamHome = dplyr::if_else(locationGame == \"H\", \r\n                                              slugTeam, \r\n                                              slugOpponent),\r\n                slugTeamAway = dplyr::if_else(locationGame == \"A\", \r\n                                              slugTeam, \r\n                                              slugOpponent)) %>%\r\n  # Drop these columns - no longer required\r\n  dplyr::select(-c(slugTeam, slugOpponent, locationGame)) %>%\r\n  dplyr::distinct(idGame, .keep_all = TRUE) %>%\r\n  # Here, we filter for the teams we want data for \r\n  # We have to use team codes. E.g. MIL = Milwaukee Bucks\r\n  # - Filter the games where either (denoted by the '|' bar) the home or \r\n  #   or away team is the Bucks. \r\n  dplyr::filter(slugTeamHome == \"MIL\" | slugTeamAway == \"MIL\")\r\n\r\n# Extract the play-by-play for each game \r\nplay_logs_all <- play_by_play_v2(game_ids = unique(games$idGame))\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce the data is downloaded, quite a bit of data pre-processing and data cleaning is required, which will not be shown in this blogpost. I have edited this code slightly from the amazing NBA blog by Ramiro Bentes. If you want to delve into the data cleaning code, it is available in the [source R markdown file] (https://github.com/guysutton/nba_analytics_blog/blob/main/_posts/2021-01-25-do-nba-players-get-tired/do-nba-players-get-tired.Rmd) for this blogpost.\r\nWe now have play-by-play data for all the Milwaukee Bucks games for the 2019/2020 season. Each game has a unique ID number (idGame), each play within each game has its own unique ID (numberEvent), and for each play, we have the players who were on the court for each team (homeTeamLineup and awayTeamLineup), amongst a range of other variables.\r\n\r\n# A tibble: 6 x 29\r\n  idGame numberEventMess~ numberEventActi~ slugTeamHome slugTeamAway\r\n  <chr>  <chr>            <chr>            <chr>        <chr>       \r\n1 21900~ 12               0                HOU          MIL         \r\n2 21900~ 10               0                HOU          MIL         \r\n3 21900~ 1                1                HOU          MIL         \r\n4 21900~ 5                1                HOU          MIL         \r\n5 21900~ 6                2                HOU          MIL         \r\n6 21900~ 3                11               HOU          MIL         \r\n# ... with 24 more variables: slugTeamPlayer1 <chr>,\r\n#   slugTeamPlayer2 <chr>, slugTeamPlayer3 <chr>, numberPeriod <chr>,\r\n#   timeQuarter <chr>, secsPassedGame <dbl>, numberEvent <dbl>,\r\n#   namePlayer1 <chr>, namePlayer2 <chr>, namePlayer3 <chr>,\r\n#   descriptionPlayHome <chr>, descriptionPlayVisitor <chr>,\r\n#   ptsHome <chr>, ptsAway <chr>, shotPtsHome <chr>,\r\n#   shotPtsAway <chr>, marginBeforeHome <chr>,\r\n#   marginBeforeAway <chr>, lineupHome <chr>, lineupAway <chr>,\r\n#   canSub <chr>, newptsHome <chr>, newptsAway <chr>, subOpp <chr>\r\n\r\nHowever, we still need to process the data so that we can:\r\nDefine how many periods each player was on the court for during each game\r\nDefine how long was each period\r\nConvert our data into long-format, so that each player who was on the court, for each play, gets their own row. (We will need this format of data when we start summarising how player performance later on).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe now know exactly which plays each player was on the court for, but we need to create a column which explicitly notes whether the player was on the court or not (stints), and how long each stint on court lasted.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Define each stint each player has on court \r\ndefine_stint <- game_test %>%\r\n  # Define stints as the cumulative sum of times the player is subbed\r\n  # cumsum starts at 0, so we need to + 1 to each value \r\n  dplyr::mutate(stints_on_court = cumsum(player_subbed == \"Yes\"),\r\n                stints_on_court = stints_on_court + 1) %>%\r\n  dplyr::ungroup() %>%\r\n  # Define start and end time of each stint with a min/max statement\r\n  dplyr::group_by(idGame, playerNames, stints_on_court) %>%\r\n  dplyr::mutate(time_at_start = min(secsPassedGame),\r\n                time_at_end   = max(secsPassedGame)) %>%\r\n  # Calculate total seconds of each stint\r\n  dplyr::mutate(time_stint_secs = time_at_end - time_at_start) %>%\r\n  # Convert seconds into minutes and seconds \r\n  dplyr::mutate(time_stint_mins = time_stint_secs / 60) %>%\r\n  # Calculate time since start of each stint \r\n  dplyr::mutate(time_since_start_stint = secsPassedGame - time_at_start) %>%\r\n  # Manually define 60 second intervals - \r\n  # I couldn't force ggplot2::cut_width to start @ 0...

A nice little trick that I have been using in recent months is to use geom_smooth instead of geom_line or geom_point to visualise the relationship between two continuous variables. This is by no means meant to be a predictive model - this is simply an exploratory data analysis (EDA) exercise.\r\n(i) Number of rebounds\r\n\r\n\r\nperform_stint_min %>%\r\n  dplyr::mutate(stints_on_court = as.factor(stints_on_court)) %>%\r\n  dplyr::mutate(minute_cats = readr::parse_double(minute_cats)) %>%\r\n  ggplot(data = ., aes(x = minute_cats, \r\n                       y = n_rebounds,\r\n                       group = stints_on_court,\r\n                       colour = stints_on_court)) +\r\n  geom_smooth(aes(fill = stints_on_court),\r\n              alpha = 0.3) +\r\n   scale_y_continuous(limit=c(0,3),oob=squish) +\r\n  #scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 2)) +\r\n  labs(x = \"Minutes on court (mins)\",\r\n       y = \"No. of rebounds \\n(per minute)\",\r\n       subtitle = \"Each panel represents a period/stint that he was on the court\") +\r\n  facet_wrap(~ stints_on_court, ncol = 3)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGiannis seems to rebound really consistently.

There is no apparent decline in scoring rate the longer he is on the court. It is no surprise that Giannis is closing in on 11 000 points for the Bucks at only 26 years old.\r\nHow many minutes should Giannis play per game?\r\nAbove we looked at Giannis’s performance (no. rebounds and 2PT scoring) per minute player during successive stints on court. This data could help us to determine how long Giannis could be expected to perform at his peak capacity for each stint he has on court (hint: his performance doesn’t decline over time). However, what if we wanted to see how many minutes Giannis should be playing per game to maximise performance?\r\n(i) Number of rebounds\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nperform_stint_game %>%\r\n  ggplot(data = ., aes(x = total_minutes_game, \r\n                       y = n_rebounds)) +\r\n  geom_smooth(colour = \"black\") +\r\n  labs(x = \"Total minutes played (mins)\",\r\n       y = \"No. of rebounds \\n(per minute)\") \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGiannis gets plenty of rebounds throughout the game, but the rate at which he rebounds does decrease over the course of the game, but increases in the last 10 minutes. There is a small lull in rebounding (<0.1 fewer rebounds) after 10 - 20 minutes on court versus his first 10 minutes. All things considered, Giannis’s rebounding rate is pretty consistent over an entire game.\r\n(ii) Number of 2PT FG’s made per game\r\n\r\n\r\nperform_stint_game %>%\r\n  #dplyr::mutate(stints_on_court = as.factor(stints_on_court)) %>%\r\n  #dplyr::mutate(total_m = readr::parse_double(minute_cats)) %>%\r\n  dplyr::filter(playerNames == \"Giannis Antetokounmpo\") %>%\r\n  ggplot(data = ., aes(x = total_minutes_game, \r\n                       y = n_2pt_made)) +\r\n  geom_smooth(colour = \"black\") +\r\n  labs(x = \"Total minutes played (mins)\",\r\n       y = \"No. of 2PT FG's made \\n(per minute)\") \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGiannis can clearly maintain his optimal 2PT scoring rate over the duration of an entire game.\r\nWhat R skills did we learn today?\r\nDownload NBA play-by-play data from the NBA API\r\nProcess the data using common tidyverse cleaning packages (e.g. dplyr, tidyr, stringr)\r\nCreate simple ggplot graphics to visualise player performance over time\r\nAnalytics implications:\r\nThe workflow presented above is how I approach exploratory data analysis (EDA) when building predictive models. I like to invest a lot of time into my EDA to get a really good understanding of the underlying data I am working with. In terms of model building, I like to only include predictor variables that appear to have some justifiable relationship with whatever our response variable is. Moreover, I like to have some idea of what form the function of y ~ x should take. For example, if we were trying to build a model to predict how many points Giannis will score per game, our EDA suggests that a linear relationship between minutes played per game and number of 2PT field goals MAY be appropriate. If we had found evidence that his 2PT scoring rate declines over time, we would then want to fit a non-linear trend for this relationship. There was a small dip in scoring rates in the 10 - 20 minute period, so we still may want a non-linear term in our model, but we could start with a linear term and build from there.\r\nPractical implications:\r\nGiannis’s performance is consistent over the course of a game. There is no obvious drop-off in his rebounding rate or 2PT scoring rates, both with respect to how many minutes he plays in each game, and with respect to how many stints on court he has and how long each stint is. It would be interesting to see how he performs above 35+ minutes per game…\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Rugby, cricket, football (soccer), golf, tennis, you name it… As I got older, my attention shifted to American football (NFL) and baseball. More recently, I have become a massive NBA fan - who can say no to a massive Jarrett Allen block, or a Giannis dunk?\r\nThis blog will serve as a space for me to combine my love for basketball and data analytics/data science that I have developed over the course of getting a PhD in the sciences. I have about 8 years of experience using the R statistical platform, which has become one of the most popular statistics programmes worldwide. Most of my work will thus be written in R, however, I hope to add to my data analysis skills by learning some new languages and skills (e.g. Julia and SQL).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
